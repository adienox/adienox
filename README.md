<h3 align="center">Not afraid to learn something new!</h3>

Hi, I'm **Adwait Adhikari**, also said as **adienox** on the web, an infatuated self-taught developer and a contract coder from Nepal. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take control within the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. Furthermore, I learned plenty from the open-source community, and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on **Personal projects and also studying, so I can get a job.**
- âš¡ Fun fact **I'm always learing something new.**
